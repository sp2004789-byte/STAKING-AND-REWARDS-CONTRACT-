# Staking and Rewards Contract

## Project Description

The Staking and Rewards Contract is a decentralized smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to stake their ETH tokens and earn passive rewards over time. This contract implements a secure and transparent staking mechanism where users can deposit their tokens, earn rewards based on a configurable annual percentage rate, and withdraw their stakes along with accumulated rewards at any time.

The contract features a user-friendly interface with three core functions: staking tokens, withdrawing tokens with rewards, and claiming rewards without unstaking. It incorporates time-based reward calculations, ensuring fair distribution of rewards based on the duration and amount of tokens staked.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized, trustless, and accessible staking platform that democratizes yield farming opportunities for all users. We aim to provide a secure and transparent environment where users can:

- **Earn Passive Income**: Generate steady returns on their cryptocurrency holdings through staking
- **Maintain Liquidity**: Retain the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time without lock-up periods
- **Participate in DeFi**: Access decentralized finance opportunities without complex protocols or intermediaries
- **Build Financial Freedom**: Create sustainable wealth through smart contract-based yield generation

We envision this contract as a foundational building block for a broader DeFi ecosystem that prioritizes user empowerment, financial inclusion, and transparent governance.
